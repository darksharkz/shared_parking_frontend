In conclusion, it can be noted that a shared parking system has been developed in this work that allows users to rent and let parking spaces, which in particular can successfully deal with a series of attacks. This distinguishes the $SPS$ from state-of-the-art shared parking systems. The functionality of the $SPS$, especially the protection against fraud, the punishment of adversaries, and the compensation of injured parties works without significant deployment costs and largely without manual intervention by the $SP$. The android prototype developed as part of this study reflects the basic functions and shows good usability and performance in first tests. Finally, topics for further research were provided.
